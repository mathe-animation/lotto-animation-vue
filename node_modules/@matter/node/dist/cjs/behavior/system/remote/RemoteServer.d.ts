/**
 * Base class for {@link Behavior}s that enable remote access to a {@link ServerNode} via a non-Matter API.
 *
 * Each protocol supported by Matter.js implements a subclass of {@link RemoteServer} and {@link RemoteInterface}.
 *
 * The {@link RemoteServer} provides a convenient interface for adding a protocol to a {@link ServerNode}.  The The
 * {@link RemoteInterface} implements the actual protocol.
 *
 * For greater control you may instantiate and manage {@link RemoteInterface} separately from {@link RemoteServer}. To
 * implement your own protocol you may extend the server implementations provided by matter.js, or create a new protocol
 * implementation by subclassing {@link RemoteInterface} yourself.
