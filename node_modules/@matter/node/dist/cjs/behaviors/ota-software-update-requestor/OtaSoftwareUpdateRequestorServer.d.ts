/**
 * This is the default server implementation of {@link OtaSoftwareUpdateRequestorBehavior}.
 *
 * To use OTA updates for matter.js based devices, you need to implement "applying the update" yourself!
 * The default implementation provides anything needed to check for updates and transfer new updates, according to the
 * Matter specification, but applying the update is too specific to your use case and the environment where the device
 * is used.
 *
 * The following custom state attributes are available to configure the behavior of the cluster:
 * * {@link updateQueryInterval}: Interval to check for updates, default: 24h as defined in Matter specification
 *
 * * {@link transferProtocolsSupported}: List of Transfer protocols that are announced as supported. By default, we only
 *     export BDX; we also support HTTPS (but basically no one else)
 *
 * * {@link canConsent}: Can the node request consent from the user for the update itself? Default is set to true, and the
 *     controller needs to take care to get the necessary consent when calling {@link requestUserConsent}.
 *
 * * {@link downloadLocation}: Option to provide a custom storage location (also backed by an own Storage solution) to store
 *     the received update file in.  If not provided, a default location is used.
 *
 *
 * For this the following extension points exist that need to be implemented:
 * * {@link requestUserConsent}: This method is needed to be implemented when you set {@link canConsent} to true and needs to
 *     implement user consent gathering.
 *
 * * {@link applyUpdate}: The method is called with the new SoftwareVersion and the PersistedFileDescriptor where a downloaded
 *     update is placed and needs to trigger the update process including shutdown and restart of the node and also
 *     sending "bootReason" event after the update!
 *
 * * {@link validateUpdateFile}: This method in default implementation reads the received OTA file and validates header and
 *     checksums and basic details. Override this method and use this.downloadLocation for access if any custom
 *     validations are needed
