/**
 * Handles atomic write handling according to Matter definitions.
 * The implementation tries to be generic, but is currently only used by the Thermostat cluster, so the atomic write
 * types are imported from there.
 *
 * The logic requires that the cluster behavior implements the following additional events as "pure Observable()" events,
 * because the current implementation logic requires error thrown by the event handlers to signal validation failures to
 * be thrown back to te emitter. This is not the case for official state events.
 * * `${attributeName}$AtomicChanging` - emitted when an attribute is changed as part of an atomic write, before the value
 *   is actually changed. Receives the new value, the old value and the action context as parameters.
 * * `${attributeName}$AtomicChanged` - emitted when an attribute is changed as part of an atomic write, after the value
 *   is actually changed. Receives the new value, the old value and the action context as parameters.
 *
 * TODO: Move out of thermostat behavior into a more generic behavior handler once used by other clusters too. Then we
 *  also need to adjust how it is handled.
 *  Proper solution might be to add the handling of the atomic Request command on interaction level and leave the
 *  transaction open until it is rolled back or committed. This might have side effects on other parts of the system though.
 *  So lets do that later when we have more clusters using it.
